    "Data visualisation, more than being part art and part science, is one of the key components of the data analytics cycle.

    "When we get to the data visualisation stage of the data analytics cycle, we should always keep in mind the nature of the data we would like to visualise. If we want to see relationships (correlations between variables) we might only choose quantitative variables for our visualisations. If we want to show a specific theme in our dataset, e.g. gender differences, customer type, or potential customer, we might just opt for visualising frequencies in qualitative data. In contrast, if we want to show the relationship of variables given a specific group in our dataset (e.g. income differences by gender), we would choose a combination of qualitative and quantitative variables.\n",

    "Static data visualisations are those meant to show one or several facts about the data in a specific way. They help us convey a message and are often used closely with other narratives. For example, the New York Times is one of the most famouss news agencies in the world not just for the top content they manage to create and provide to the masses, but also for the beautiful and informative visualisations one can find in their work.\n",

These kinds of visualisations can be very powerful tools not only to convey different messages at scale but also to provide top-notch educational content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Involving your audience through interactive visualisations can be a much more involved process though. A static visualisation can be saved and shared with many in a matter of minutes. Interactive visualisations, on the other hand, might require a web application to work and be displayed from, making it more difficult to show it to people on the go. Dashboards and other tools require a bit more work to be put together but can have a lot useful interactivity in them."
