    "Data visualisation, more than being part art and part science, is one of the key components of the data analytics cycle. People have different learning styles and to be able to convey information in a more accessible way, sometimes it is better to do so through visualisations rather than tables and written text. So..\n",

    "> \"Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\" ~ [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/learn/articles/data-visualization)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Visualization as a field of study has been on the rise for over many decades now --if not centuries-- and it is an exciting area to be a part of. Organisations such as the [Data Visualization Society](https://www.datavisualizationsociety.com/), FreeCodeCamp, and others, have extensive information on how to go beyond simple data visualisation, should that be something that interests you. If you would like to read more about data visualisation and what you can do with it, check out this [medium site](https://medium.com/nightingale).\n",

    "## 1.2 Quantitative vs Qualitative\n",
    "\n",
    "When we get to the data visualisation stage of the data analytics cycle, we should always keep in mind the nature of the data we would like to visualise. If we want to see relationships (correlations between variables) we might only choose quantitative variables for our visualisations. If we want to show a specific theme in our dataset, e.g. gender differences, customer type, or potential customer, we might just opt for visualising frequencies in qualitative data. In contrast, if we want to show the relationship of variables given a specific group in our dataset (e.g. income differences by gender), we would choose a combination of qualitative and quantitative variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give you a more concrete example, I have burrowed the following table from a book that I highly recommend if you want to really get started with data visualization, and that is, _\"Fundamentals of data visualization: A primer on making informative and compelling figures\"_ by Claus O.

    "## 1.3 Static vs Interactive Visualizations\n",
    "\n",
    "An important aspect to keep in mind is when creating visualizations is whether we should represent our data in a static or interactive format. As analysts, we should always ask ourselves, will our message reach our audience better if they were able to interact with the visualisation? The reason behind this can be captured in a very famous quote by Benjamin Franklin.\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.\" ~ Benjamin Franklin\n",
    "\n",
    "If the goal of our visualisations is to teach something to our audience chances are that, allowing them to interact with our visualisation will do just that. Let's talk a bit more about static and interactive visualisations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.1 Static DataViz\n",
    "\n",
    "Static data visualisations are those meant to show one or several facts about the data in a specific way. They help us convey a message and are often used closely with other narratives. For example, the New York Times is one of the most famouss new agencies in the world not just for the top content they manage to craete and provide to the masses, but also for the beautiful visualisations one can find in their large amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Static visualisations are also often embedded in inforgraphics to carry a message even further. Think about the graphs that are displayed in broshures that tell us to buy a fragance or a particular type of cutlery alongside a statistic, some often say \"75% of those who purchased these products have experienced...blah blah blah\". Watch out for those :)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.3.2 Interactive DataViz\n",
    "\n",
    "Interactive data visualisations tell different stories while letting the users pick which one they would like to see or understand better as they evaluate the piece of work. These kinds of visualisations can be very powerful tools not only to convey messages to many people but also to provide top-notch educational content for others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Involving your audience through interactive visualisations can be a much more involved process though. A static visualisation can be saved and shared with many in a matter of minutes. Interactive visualisations, on the other hand, might require a web application to work and be displayed, making it more difficult to show it to people on the go. Dashboards and other tools, while requiring a bit more work to be put together, can have a lot useful interactivity in them."
